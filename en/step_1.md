Scratch provides the ability to comment on your own and other people's projects. If you do not want to allow people to comment on your project, you should turn off commenting:

![The slider above the 'Comments' box is set to 'Commenting off'. The slider is grey and is in the 'Commenting off' position.](images/comments-off.png){:width="300px"}

If you are happy and feel safe to allow people to write comments on your project, you can leave the first comment:

--- no-print ---

![Typing "Here's my walking cat animation" in the 'Comments' box, then clicking the blue 'Post' button to post the comment. The slider above the 'Comments' box is set to 'Commenting on' and has turned from grey to green.](images/add_comments.gif)

--- /no-print ---

--- print-only ---

![Clicking the blue 'Post' button below the comment to post it. The slider above the 'Comments' box is set to 'Commenting on' and has turned from grey to green.](images/add_comments.png){:width="300px"}

If you think a project or comment is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, click the **Report** button on the Project Page to let Scratch know about it:
